This project involves mass spectrometry-based proteomics of human skeletal muscle fibers in males and females before and after 8 weeks of resistance training. Single muscle fibers were dissected from all participants and pooled as type I and type II fibers at pre and post time points based on dot blotting against MYH7 and MYH2. This enables comparison of differences in the skeletal muscle proteome between sexes and fiber types and how the sex- and fiber type-specific proteome adapts to resistance training.
